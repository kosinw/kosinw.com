import RSSView from "components/RSSView";

This page is part of an assignment for my high school senior year computer science class. 
This page loads in copypastas from an RSS feed off of [r/im15andthisisyeet](https://old.reddit.com/r/im15andthisisyeet).

*I know,* it's better to use reddit's API directly, but the assignment requires the use of RSS.
